# Warmart-Store-Sales-Prediction

## Overview
This purpose of the project is to build a machine learing model based on the weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores in Texas, Wisconsin and California from 2010 to
2012. The performance of the model is compared to a linear regression model.

## Data Description
This compiled dataset was pulled from three otherdatasets linked by Date and Store ID, and was builtto explore what other factors, other than the seasonal variations, contribute to store sales.

The datasets include the following information that
we used to analyze factors related to store sales:
* Date 
* Store Type & Size
* Promotion Type
* Temperature
* Economic Data
